# Control subpackage

The Pynamics control subpackage provides a basic dummy controller to help with open loop simulations.
It also provides a base controller class, from which every controller compatible with Pynamics should inherit.

## Modules

- [base](base.md): Contains the controller base class.

- [dummy](dummy.md): Contains the Pynamics dummy controller.
